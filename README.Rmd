# Upper Columbia Steelhead Time Series

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KevinSee/UCSthdTimeSeries/master?urlpath=rstudio)

This repository contains the data and code to create a long time-series of steelhead spawner abundance, by origin, in the Wenatchee subbasin. It uses more recent estimates that involve incorporating redd observer error models to adjust redd counts and PIT tag based escapement models to estimate spawners in the tributaries. These estimates from recent years are associates with estimates using an older method, and a cross walk between them is developed. This cross walk is then applied to the older years of the complete time-series.
